1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Meta-data is created, this allows git to function.
2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area is for the files that are prepared and ready for a commit to the repository.  It separates the files from the working directory in order for easier tracking.
3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	When I am done editing a file, I stage it making it ready for a commit.		
4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	Branches would be good to have versions for adding new features such as languages.  The master branch would be working code, while a branch for another language could be separate until it is a working version.
5. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	concepts represented visually are much easier to learn and understand.
6. What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
	I am not able to merge because I am getting an error.
