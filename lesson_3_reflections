1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    Remote repository would be useful if I am using multiple computers to work on a project.  The project would be accessible from any computer.
2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You might be using several computers, you might have logical changes that you want to sync, you might have another branch you want to sync with github.
